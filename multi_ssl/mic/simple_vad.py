class VoiceActivityDetection:
    """
    There are three criteria to decide if a frame contains speech: energy, most
    dominant frequency, and spectral flatness. If any two of those are higher than
    a minimum plus a threshold, then the frame contains speech.  In the offline
    case, the list of frames is postprocessed to remove too short silence and
    speech sequences. In the online case here, inertia is added before switching
    from speech to silence or vice versa.

    Augments
    --------
    num_init_frames : int
        take the first n frames as silece, default is 30.
    ignore_silent_count : int
        still treat silence as speech if ran less than counter, default is 4.
    ignore_speech_count : int
        still treat speech as silence if ran less than counter, default is 1.
    energy_prim_thresh : int
        mark as a speech frame if get over the threshold, default is 20.
    frequency_prim_thresh : int
        mark as a speech frame if get over the threshold, default is 10.
    spectral_flatness_prim_thresh : int
        mark as a speech frame if get over the threshold, default is 3.
